•Tools and technologies used:
Java, Oracle Database, Java Database Connectivity, Eclipse IDE.

•The first phase of this project involves designing a database schema for a bookstore.

•The bookstore consists of an array of books on different topics written by multiple authors.

•The next phase involves executing multiple queries on the populated bookstore database in order to produce the results of the user requests.

•The queries corresponding to the user requests include selecting a specific book depending upon it's price, the name of the author, the specified date, field of study etc. or multiple books belonging to the same department, falling into the same price range, published by the same company etc.

•An integral part of this project involves establishing a successful connection between the java program(the processing part) and the bookstore database(back end) to produce the desired results, which was implemented using Java Database Connectivity(JDBC) API technology.
